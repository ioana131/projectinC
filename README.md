For this project I worked alone. The main idea of this project was to implement in C a table tennis match management system. The application allowed the entry of multiple table tennis match results played in large sets. The application provides the option to view a ranking based on the most wins by a player. For each player, a history of matches, as well as the number of matches won or lost, can be viewed.

This program displays a menu on the screen and the user can select options from the menu. It reads from the files and also saves data to files. For this program I had to use struct to store in app data and also different functions.
