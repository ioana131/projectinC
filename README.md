For this project, I worked alone. The main idea of the project was to implement a table tennis match management system in C. The application allows the entry of multiple table tennis match results played in large sets. It provides the option to view a ranking based on the number of wins per player. For each player, a match history, along with the number of matches won or lost, can be viewed.

The program displays a menu on the screen, and the user can select options from it. It reads data from files and also saves data to files. I used structs to store data within the application, along with various functions to handle operations.
